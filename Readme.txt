the local directory named moreLinux is as Random_Linux-commands on Github.

------About the Repo------
Contains some random discovered commands to make your workflow faster.
Aim is to do all the things without leaving the terminal.

NOTE- written to make me remind the commands, sometimes it might not make much sense to you. Sorry about that.

And that is all.
See ya.
