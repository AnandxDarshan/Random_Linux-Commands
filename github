----The aim is to create a repo of a local directory then commit and push the contents without leaving the terminal----

I'm going to use apt package manager while describing or mentioning the command, you will have to find your package manager (yours could be anything from yum, pacman or etc ) and the syntax it follows on your own.


if not installed ( install the gh utility : as usual, for debian; the command is: sudo apt install gh -y )

gh auth login --> setup your github CLI

sudo apt install git ( if not installed already )

first navigate to the directory that you want to create a repo of on github.

Important commands:
------------------
1> git init

2> gh repo create "Repo_name_that_you_want" --public (or --private)
	- creates the repo either visible pubically or private, based on the option mentioned in the command.

3> git remote add origin git@github.com:github-Username/Repo_name_that_you_defined_earlier.git

4> git add .

5> git commit -m "commit description"

6> git push -u origin master
