Vim is a full featured text editor. 

 

It is so vast, that a video as long as this entire course can be made on it. 

 

Vim is modal editor (mode-based). 

 

Vim has three modes: 

Command (default) 

Input (insert) 

Last-line 

 

Important options in vim: 

 

:i  enter --> to enter in insert mode. ( this is an overview , better options are discussed below). 

 

:q enter --> to quit the editor. 

 

:wq enter --> write(save) then quit the editor. 

 

:q! enter --> quit without saving 

 

 

 

Explaining some stuff about vim: 

 

When we start the vim, it is in command mode. That means whatever we press or write will be considered as command and will not be inserted in the file. 

 

Vim has lots of commands. 

 

Finding text (search) 

It uses similar syntax to that of less command. i.e., a forward slash followed by the text we want to search : /search_text + enter 

 


 

Then we can use can use the following for next/previous appearance of the text in the file: 

Lower-case n ( n ) --> next appearance. 

Upper-case n (N) --> previous appearance 

 

 

Moving cursor in the vim 

 

l  -->  moves cursor to right 

k --> moves cursor  to up 

j -->  moves cursor to down 

h --> moves cursor to left 

 

0 --> moves cursor  to the beginning of the line. 

$ --> moves cursor to the end of the line. 

 

:line_number --> moves cursor to the line. 

 

gg  --> top beginning 

G --> end 

 

Ctrl + b --> move up a screen ( pageUp ) 

Ctrl + f --> move down a screen ( pageDown ) 

 

 

Important 

 

To start inserting text in the file, we need to switch from command mode ( the default mode ) to the insert mode : 

 

i --> let us start inserting text before the cursor's position. 

 

Esc --> to exit out of insert mode back to command mode. 

 

a --> to start inserting text after the cursor's position. 

 

x --> deletes the text that the cursor is on. 

 

u --> undo 

 

Ctrl + r --> redo 

 

r --> to replace the letter from some other. 

 

dd --> to delete the entire line. 

 

5dd --> deletes 5 lines from the current line. 

 

 

Vim also has cut, copy and paste features, but for that we'll need to enter in visual mode: 

v --> visual mode. 

 

Use arrow keys to select the text. 

 

y (yank) --> to copy selected. 

 

p  --> to paste after the cursor's position. 

 

P --> to paste before the cursor's position. 

 

Cutting ( first get in visual mode, then select the text ) 

d --> to cut selected. 

p/P --> to paste ( same as earlier ).
